     This is a dummy used to understand float.A flower, also known as a bloom or blossom,[1] is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the
    division Angiospermae). Flowers consist of a combination of vegetative organs â€“ sepals that enclose and protect the
    developing flower. Petals attract pollinators, and reproductive organs that produce gametophytes, which in flowering
    plants produce gametes. The male gametophytes, which produce sperm, are enclosed within pollen grains produced in the
    anthers. The female gametophytes are contained within the ovules produced in the ovary.[2][3] In some plants, multiple
    flowers occur singly on a pedicel (flower stalk), and some are arranged in a group (inflorescence) on a peduncle
    (inflorescence stalk).[2]
