        Pizza[a][1] is an Italian dish typically consisting of a flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomato,
        cheese, and other ingredients, baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.

       PREPARATION:
        Pizza is sold fresh or frozen, and whole or in portion-size slices. Methods have been developed to overcome challenges
        such as preventing the sauce from combining with the dough, and producing a crust that can be frozen and reheated
        without becoming rigid. There are frozen pizzas with raw ingredients and self-rising crusts.
        
        In the US, another form of pizza is available from take and bake pizzerias. This pizza is assembled in the store, then
        sold unbaked to customers to bake in their own ovens. Some grocery stores sell fresh dough along with sauce and basic
        ingredients, to assemble at home before baking in an oven.

    <p class="boxmodel">A popular legend holds that the archetypal pizza, pizza Margherita,[35] was invented in 1889, when the Royal Palace of
    Capodimonte commissioned the Neapolitan pizzaiolo ('pizza maker') Raffaele Esposito to create a pizza in honor of the
    visiting Queen Margherita. Of the three different pizzas he created, the queen strongly preferred a pizza swathed in the
    colors of the Italian flag—red (tomato), white (mozzarella), and green (basil). Supposedly, this type of pizza was then
    named after the queen,[36] with an official letter of recognition from the queen's "head of service" remaining to this
    day on display in Esposito's shop, now called the Pizzeria Brandi.[37] Later research cast doubt on this legend,
    undermining the authenticity of the letter of recognition, pointing that no media of the period reported about the
    supposed visit and that both the story and name Margherita were first promoted in the 1930s–1940s.[38][39]</p>
